## Abstract

Facades are services in Angular applications decoupling the view layer from application logic.
Especially in large enterprise applications facades can be used to divide development tasks related to logic (state management, REST API communication, ...) and view (layout, styling, ...).

In this talk we critically examine possibilities and disadvantages of introducing yet another layer into our Angular applications.

## About the Author

Danilo works as a Software Developer for the e-commerce company Intershop in Thuringia, located in the green heart of Germany. Just as he started working there, the decision was made to launch the development for a new storefront based on Angular. Even though he never worked with Angular before (his background is mainly Java and some C++), it turned into one of the best love stories of the current decade. Nowadays, whenever he is not working on the project, he likes spending time improving his cooking skills or reading about psychology.
